* Navigation Tracking - Powerful funnel analysis and robust screen tracking enables you to understand the navigation patterns in your app in order to better capitalize on the dynamic configurability of our UI Builder  
* Broad Integrations - Fully baked into the Google and Firebase ecosystem, you can capitalize on revenue data from the Google Play Store, track the effectiveness of app marketing campaigns via Google Ads and several other acquisition channels, and dump data directly into BigQuery, and more.  
* Audience Centric - Capitalizing on Google's enormous data capture and modeling, Firebase enables you to get a strong sense of your users' demographics and interests and even slice behavioral data by this information.  
* No data limit on events - As opposed to the traditional Google Analytics platform, there are no data limits on how many events you can send and the platform never resorts to sampling.  
* User Data - Enrich your audience analysis by delivering any non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) user data to the platform, creating user groups based on that information, and segmenting any other analytics feature (e.g. actions, funnels, retention) by these user groups  
 
**Pricing :**  Google Analytics for Firebase is completely free.
