This repository contains the code for Google Analytics for Firebase (Android, iOS), formerly known as "Firebase Analytics"

## Intro to Zapp Plugins

A Zapp Plugin is a software module, that adds a specific feature to an app built in the Zapp platform. A Plugin provides an implementation of a Protocol/Interface by the Zapp SDK, to enable the integration of a 3rd party library or a custom code.
Zapp supports different types of plugins: App Navigation, Datasource Providers, Media Players, Login & Payments, Full Screen UI, Analytics Providers, push providers and more.

An Analytics Plugin provides an implementation of sending analytics data to an Analytics Provider as the user interacts with the app.
